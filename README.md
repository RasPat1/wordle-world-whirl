Orate is a word which uses the 5 most popular letters.

Guessing orate is not necessarily the best start strategy though. If you used a word which had 5 fairly unique letters a "hit" would severely narrow down the library. that another possible strategy. It depends are you trying to maximize the probability of getting the lowest score on one attempt on 100 attempts? Do you want to find the "rare" letters in the word because it's easier to think of those words.

Would the location of those letters be important? S is a common ending letter, i is not for example.
Do we want the letter frequency in each slot? Is that useful?

Should we just program an AI to solve this and see what strategies they come up with? This seems really interesting.
Look we're not in the age of actually writing imperativ code anymore. Forget coming up with strategies and using data to find how to implement them. That's so pre-ai. Now just throw your problem wholemeal into the AI thresher and try and interpret the strategies machina ex deus.
