# Entropy Approach
---

Given a list of candidate words determine how much entropy the set has.
The best candidates cause the largest decreases in entropy.

## Defining entropy
---
How do we define the entropy of a word and a gropu of words. Is this a per letter basis? no.


The entropy of a set is independent of the guessesd word right?
Look at the possible results to define entropy.
