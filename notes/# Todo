# Todo
-----
* Add a filter function for finding the next word

* docker
* Bazel (some build tool)

* Split tests into their own folder
* Add flag or using profiler and separate out the code from the main logic.
* Clean up that "upstream" cache logic

* Convert into a webapp and have user input

* Add a cache decorator (for fun!)
* multithreading (for fun!)


# Done
-----
* autolinting
* lolcommits
* Fix tests
* Tests to work with module imports (just run them from the src dir...)



# How does this work?
----
-- Filter
Given a dictionary of words, a word and a "diff" with an unknown solution reduce the dictionary to possible matches.

-- Best guess
This is the geuss that filters the dictionary to the smallest possible set of matches.

-- Best Guess on Average
Given a set of possible guesses and a set of possible answers find the guess which, on average, most reduces the answer set.
  -- Filter the dictionary for a given (guess, solution)combination. Average the reduction amongst all possible solutions for a guess. Return the guesses in order of best to worst.

-- Best Guessing Path.
Find the average best guess. Apply that guess and get a "diff". Reduce the dictionary based on that diff. The reduced dictionary becomes the new dictionary. Repeat (Find the average best guess for the new dictionary. etc)

-- Best guessing path on average.

What is the best pair of guesses without any information?
