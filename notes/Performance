Performance

So
Really exciting stuff here.
I ended up makin gthis work for the multi combo thing. I've used the python cache instead of a manual cache. It's way more performant.
I have moved all of the actual work into cahces now. yay! But the tradeoff is i'm now spending a lot of time doing set operations.


I think the way to acutayl optimize this is to represet the corpus as a 1-hot array...

With the set operations we're at:
95)]
         21849912 function calls (21849900 primitive calls) in 11.984 seconds
for a dicrionary of 181 words.


okay! With this weird binary shit we got down to 6 aeconds. wtf.
Did we get the right answer? definitely not.

oaky. Looks liek we're spending 20% of our time calculating the average at the end. That seems liek too much.
we shaved 20% off by just using sum instead of mean. This is fine.

Another 10% off by not counting individual guesses. Just solutions instead
