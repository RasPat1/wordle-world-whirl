For the test corpus on the minmal path it says "mince". This is ignoring the guess corpus.
Let's try with the full corpus ignoring the guess corpus in the minimal path alg.
the mp alg on the test corpus reduces the dict to 17. The bf alg on full corpus reduces to 25.
The bf alfg on the test corpus also reduces to 17. So that's good.

The mp alg is super duper slow.
It's best guess still says mince for the full corpus. Mince isn't even in the top 20 for the bf sovler. Let's do mince and see how we do.
wow that was a good guess
mince = 'ammmm'
Wooo! It was wince.
Let's see how we would have done with the other algorithm.

mp alg
raise -> mince -> wince (100%)
2315 -> 25 -> 1

bf alg
raise -> lingo -> cramp -> wince (100%)
2315 -> 25 -> 2 -> 1

UM bf alg has a bug for sure. It's got a corpus size of 2 and it's giving a bnchof stupid as guesses none of which are in the solution_corpus.

yeah that's my fault. I didn't include the solution corpus in the potential guesses. Called the fn wrong.
Hmm still wrong. I mean it's suggesting a random value that reduces the corpus by 1. It should suggest something that reduces the corpus by 1 and is in the solution corpus.
